Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

## My Opinions on Version Control

The thing which i like the most about the version control is that it allows me to keep track of all the changes that i make while working on any file.
On the other hand, I feel like while resolving merge conflicts sometimes confusing one needs to be extra caution while dealing with this, especially when there are collaborators working on the same file.
